    <h2 class="title">key features and benefits</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4 ">
           <p><h3> Water Quality Monitoring:</h3>Smart water fountains are equipped with sensors that monitor the quality of the water they dispense. This includes checking for impurities, temperature, and pH levels. If any issues are detected, the fountain can send alerts for maintenance or shut off the water supply.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Automatic Refilling:</h3> Many smart water fountains are connected to the building's water supply and have automatic refilling mechanisms. This ensures a continuous supply of clean drinking water without the need for manual refilling, as seen in traditional water fountains.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Filtration and Purification:</h3> Some smart water fountains include built-in filtration and purification systems to remove contaminants and improve the taste and quality of the water. These systems can be monitored and controlled remotely.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Touchless Operation:</h3> In line with the trend of touchless technology, smart water fountains often feature motion sensors or touchless dispensers to reduce the spread of germs and promote hygiene.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Usage Data and Analytics:</h3> These fountains can collect data on water usage, including the number of people using them, the volume of water dispensed, and peak usage times. This information can be useful for optimizing maintenance schedules and water conservation efforts.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Water Temperature Control:</h3> Smart fountains may allow users to select the temperature of the water they want, providing options for cold, room temperature, and hot water.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Remote Monitoring and Control:</h3> Maintenance staff or facility managers can remotely monitor the status of smart water fountains, receive alerts for maintenance needs, and even control various functions, such as adjusting water temperature or turning the fountain on and off.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="col-4">
            <p><h3>Integration with Building Management Systems:</h3> Smart water fountains can be integrated with a building's management system, allowing for centralized control and coordination with other building functions, such as lighting and HVAC systems.</p>

            <h1>Circuit Design</h1>
            <p>The real-time clock module is connected to the Arduino. The Arduino is programmed to turn ON the pump at a designated time. The pump is connected to the relay and 12V power through a 12mm PVC tube. The water supply is enabled through a 20 litre tank, enough to keep the watering for a few weeks.</p>
